<h1 id="structural-editing">Structural Editing</h1>
<p><img style="float: right; margin: 0.2em 0em 0em 2em;" src="/img/articles/ambiguous.png" /> Structural editing is not a new idea, but it has never really taken hold. So, what are the advantages of structural editing? Why hasn't it caught on?</p>
<p>With a plain text representation you don't always have a nice AST to work with and meaning can be ambiguous. It's not an unsolvable problem, and text editors can actually do a good job what I'm going to show you. None of these things are impossible with traditional text editing, but it <em>does</em> make the problem harder. I believe structural editing has a lot of potential.</p>
<h2 id="the-prototype">The Prototype</h2>
<p>This is a rough prototype with no performance optimisation. Play around with it. Try to write a map and filter function.</p>
<p>The language itself is a very simple lisp-like language with type inference. There are no strings (which pose an interesting UI problem), only numbers and functions.</p>
<p>The advantage here, as I hope you can see from the video above, is continuous feedback. On every keystroke the editor auto-completes, infers types, pops up error messages and lays out the expressions. The errors are precisely pointed out in the syntax tree.</p>
<p>Documentation is also continuously updated. Similar to working with a lisp image, you can see documentation in the auto completions, and browse what is available to use at any point in the tree.</p>
<p>One downside to structural editing is tooling. Programmer tools, like grep and git, have been developed for text. They will have to be reworked for an AST representation, and there are a <em>lot</em> of man-hours invested in these tools. Some of them have been in use for decades. There is an upside: we have a bit more information to work with. For example, we can merge trees instead of lines.</p>
