# Superagile

There is no recipe to follow for success. Use principles to guide your
way, but your team has to do the hard work and find what works for
them. By all means try things out, but find something that works for
your team instead of forcing a square peg into a round hole.

Miscommunication happens. People change their minds. Situations
change. Getting stakeholder (other programmers, managers, clients,
etc.) feedback sooner rather than later ensures you don't wander too
far down the wrong path. On the other hand, don't create a feedback
loop so tight that you can't get work done.

If your stakeholders or peers are not communicating, or were never on
board in the first place, there is no process that can save you.

Constant analysis and improvement. Bad reasons for doing things are
because "you read it in a blog post [1]", "we've always done it this way",
"this is what everybody else does", or because "it's my gut
feeling". Avoid automatic thinking. Ask yourselves what you want to
achieve. Is what you're doing achieving this? If not, find something
better. Examine everything. Keep improving. Decide as a team how to do
this.
