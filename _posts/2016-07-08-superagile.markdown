# Superagile

When it comes to software development, I don't believe there is a one
size fits all recipe to follow for success. Therefore, I believe the
most important aspect of any process is that it improves and refines
itself. You can use principles to guide your way, but your team has to
do the hard work and find what works for them.

Miscommunication happens. People change their minds. Situations
change. Getting stakeholder (other programmers, managers, clients,
etc.) feedback sooner rather than later ensures you don't wander too
far down the wrong path. On the other hand, don't create a feedback
loop that is too tight. You need room to work intelligently.

If your stakeholders or peers are not communicating, or were never on
board with the way you work in the first place, there is no process
that can save you.

Constant analysis and improvement. Bad reasons for doing things are
because "you read it in a blog post<sup>1</sup>", "we've always done
it this way", "this is what everybody else does", or because "it's my
gut feeling". Avoid automatic thinking. Ask yourselves what you want
to achieve. Is what you're doing achieving this? If not, find
something better. Examine everything. Keep improving. Decide as a team
how to do this.
