# A Fantasy of Unambiguity

In my current job, with its autonomous teams, a question often pops
up: under whose jurisdiction should this piece of architecture lie?
Common to all my jobs is the question of how to organise code. Which
module should this code be added to?

It can only mean one thing: it's time for a game of Taxonomy!

The rules of Taxonomy: start with the assumption that the system has
been miraculously and perfectly divided up, and that there is one true
niche to be found as ordained by some natural law of the universe, and
then proceed to have about an hour of the most tedious back-and-forth
discussion you are ever likely to have in your life.

People really, really like to put things in neat little boxes, but
classification is built on language and language is kind of
_fuzzy_. When trying to decide if something belongs in box X or box Y,
consider that the answer may be both. Or neither. Or box Z which
doesn't exist yet.

I'm not saying that people shouldn't try to organise things, but when
there are multiple valid answers, I say this with all my love and
kindness: JUST PICK ONE! And then we can all go to the pub.
