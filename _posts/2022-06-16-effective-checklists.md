# Effective Checklists

☑ Checklists are useless if people ignore them, so decrease the mental
burden of your checks as much as possible.

☑ Keep the list as short and focused as possible.

☑ Keep only the most important checks.

☑ Each check should be applicable in every circumstance.

☑ Have clear, straightforward conditions for completing the check.

☑ Avoid conjunctions such as 'or', 'and', 'but' and 'if'.
