# Gut Driven Development

One mistake I commonly observe in myself and others is developing with
'gut feeling'. Arguing against subjective opinions can be difficult
and frustrating, and two people with contradicting 'gut feelings' can
be disastrous. It is a common cause of tension and discord in teams of
developers.

In my experience, you can almost always examine your opinions and find
some objective advantage. If you can't, your opinion probably isn't
very solid. Recognising your gut feelings and examining them can be
eye opening, and can make you a better developer. For example:

- "This code should be formatted this way."
- "Why? Because it is more readable."
- "That's subjective! Is it more readable or am I just more familiar with it?"
- "Isn't it actually more important that the formatting is simply consistent with the rest of the code?"
- "The reader can then learn to recognise the pattern of the code."

I think the best way to recognise and analyse gut feelings is by
understanding your biases. I have chosen this example very
deliberately as it is my most commonly observed bias: that something
is better because it is familiar to you.

The second most common is the opposite: that something is better
because it is *new*. It is easy to project your hopes on to something
before you have experienced its failings. This is especially true for
technologies that make trade-offs (e.g. databases). It is easier to
see the advantages of the trade-off than the disadvantages i.e. the
grass is always greener. This bias explains the hype cycle you often
see.

Once you recognise [biases like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) it will become clear to you that
people often start with a biased opinion and then reason backwards
from there to support it. You'll do it too, and it's OK to do that as
long as you can examine it and put forward a solid argument. Never
think biases don't apply to you.
