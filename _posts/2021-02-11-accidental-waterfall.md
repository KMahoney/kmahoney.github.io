# Accidental Waterfall

<strong>Accidental Waterfall</strong><br /> A decision that has
unacknowledged organisational or political barriers hindering its reevaluation.
</div>

Carving boundaries between teams almost
always carves technical boundaries into the same ground. This means
where you divide teams is a *technical design decision* -- it has an
impact on your architecture and all design that follows.

These boundaries can be difficult to reevaluate because it is no longer
only a technical matter. There's now resistance to change
from people within the organisation and the structure of the organisation itself.
It can become almost impossible to merge teams together or redefine borders,
because this now threatens autonomy, takes away ownership, and dilutes influence.

You could say certain design paths are discouraged. Not necessarily because they
are technically difficult to do, but because they would now be unpopular.

No matter how poorly the architecture works, your choices have been
restricted. You cannot go backwards from here to reevaluate or
iterate. You have fallen down a waterfall.

Isn't this the essence of what is wrong with the waterfall model of
software design?  It is sometimes mistakenly blamed on up-front
design, but the true problem is organisational barriers preventing change.
Each step of a solution must conform to a decision made in a
previous step, no matter what you discover along the way or how
unsuitable those decisions seem now.

Beneath the acronyms, the consultants and the cargo-culting, what is
essentially good about 'agile' is *iteration*.

I doubt we can entirely stop organisational structure or process
from limiting design or preventing iteration, but perhaps we can at least stop it
from unconsciously growing out of control.

Let's not pretend we are enlightened and 'agile' and that we
have left the problems of the waterfall model to the dark
recesses of software development history. It still lurks
in more subtle forms.

What can't you challenge?
Where aren't you iterating?
Perhaps you are accidentally falling down waterfalls.
