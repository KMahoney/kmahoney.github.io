# Alerts, Checklists, and Lazy Thinking

Developers can be lazy thinkers. Don't blame them (or *me*) for this.
It's natural to take mental shortcuts when you get tired, and if
you're spending weeks on complex projects you will get tired.

Alerts and checklists are both great things to have, but there are
some common mistakes that quickly turn them into useless background
noise for tired brains.

## Alerts

The most important quality of an alert is that it is actionable. There
should always be something you need to do when an alert happens, or it
shouldn't be an alert. Ideally it should require an *immediate* action.

Useful information is not necessarily an alert; maybe log it, or
compile it into a daily report, but don't mix it in with alerts that
require action.

Once an alert happens two or three times and no action is needed, it
will start being ignored. And worse, other alerts mixed in with it
will start being ignored too!

## Checklists

For checklists, minimize the thought needed. Don't have checklist items
that only apply under certain conditions. Each checklist item should always
apply, and it should be easy to perform the check.

Once a checklist item is irrelevant two or three times it will start
being ignored. And worse, other useful checklist items will start
being ignored too!
