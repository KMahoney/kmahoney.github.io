# Explain Why

When working with a team of developers there are two skills I'd like
to immediately transplant into everyone's brains, Matrix Kung-Fu style:

- Write code for people to read.
- Document *why*.

When writing code it's easy to start focusing on solving the problem
at hand and lose sight of the fact that your code will have to be
maintained by other people. It's easy to forget that people are your
audience, not the computer. The computer doesn't care about your
comments, your formatting, your function names, or your
abstractions. It just does what it has been told. You're writing those
things for people. Often *other* people.

Documenting 'why' is a very difficult skill. Why? Because when you are
in the midst of writing code you already know why you are writing
it. If you didn't know why you were writing it, you wouldn't be writing
it. To effectively document 'why' you need to see the code as if you
were seeing it for the first time. You need to get into the head of
another person and have a good feel for when something is intuitive
and when something needs more explanation.

If there is something I'd like to erase from their brains, Eternal
Sunshine style, it would be the notion that code is
self-documenting. Code can only explain *what* it is doing, not *why*.
