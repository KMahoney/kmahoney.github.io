# Explain Why

When working with a team of developers there are two skills I'd like
to immediately transplant into everyone's brains, Matrix Kung-Fu
style. I enjoy working with people who can do these things well.

## Write Code for People to Read

When writing code it's easy to start focusing on solving the problem
at hand and lose sight of the fact that your code will have to be
maintained by other people. It's easy to forget that people are your
audience, not the computer. The computer doesn't care about your
comments, your formatting, your function names, or your
abstractions. It just does what it has been told. You're writing those
things for people, and not just yourself.

## Why

Documenting 'why' is a very difficult skill. Why? Because when you are
in the midst of writing code you *already know* why you are writing
it. If you didn't know why you were writing it, you wouldn't be
writing it. It's so obvious to you in that moment why you are writing
that code, you don't feel you need to document it.

To effectively document 'why' you need to see the code as if you were
seeing it for the first time. You need to get into the head of another
person and have a good feel for when something is intuitive and when
something needs more explanation.

## Self-Documenting Code

If there is something I'd like to erase from their brains, Eternal
Sunshine style, it would be the notion that code is
self-documenting. Code can only explain *what* it is doing, not *why*.
