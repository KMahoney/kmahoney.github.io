<h1>Big Bang</h1>
<p>The <b>Big Bang</b> theory is the prevailing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology" title="Physical cosmology">cosmological</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_model" title="Scientific model" class="mw-redirect">model</a> for the earliest known periods of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe" title="Universe">universe.</a> It states that the Universe was in a very high density state and then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space" title="Metric expansion of space">expanded.</a> If the known laws of physics are extrapolated beyond where they are valid there is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity" title="Gravitational singularity">singularity.</a> Modern measurements place this moment at approximately 13.8 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,000,000,000_(number)" title="1,000,000,000 (number)" class="mw-redirect">billion</a> years ago, which is thus considered the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe" title="Age of the universe">age of the universe.</a> After the initial expansion, the Universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle" title="Subatomic particle">subatomic particles,</a> and later simple atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity" title="Gravity" class="mw-redirect">gravity</a> to form <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star" title="Star">stars</a> and galaxies. The Big Bang theory does not provide any explanation for the initial conditions of the Universe; rather, it describes and explains the general evolution of the Universe going forward from that point on.</p>
<p>Since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lema%C3%AEtre" title="Georges Lemaître">Georges Lemaître</a> first noted, in 1927, that an expanding universe might be traced back in time to an originating single point, scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion. While the scientific community was once divided between supporters of two different expanding universe theories, the Big Bang and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady_State_theory" title="Steady State theory">Steady State theory,</a> accumulated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence" title="Empirical evidence">empirical evidence</a> provides strong support for the former. In 1929, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble" title="Edwin Hubble">Edwin Hubble</a> discovered indications that all galaxies are drifting apart at high speeds. In 1964, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation" title="Cosmic microwave background radiation" class="mw-redirect">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> was discovered, which was crucial evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, since that theory predicted the existence of background radiation throughout the Universe before it was discovered. The known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_law" title="Physical law">physical laws of nature</a> can be used to calculate the characteristics of the Universe in detail back in time to an initial state of extreme <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density" title="Density">density</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature" title="Temperature">temperature.</a></p>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Hubble observed that the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift" title="Redshift">redshifts.</a> This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction. According to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_principle" title="Copernican principle">Copernican principle</a> (that the Earth is not the center of the Universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the Universe are receding from all others. Since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion of the Universe implies that the Universe was denser and hotter in the past.</p>
<p>Large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator" title="Particle accelerator">particle accelerators</a> can replicate the conditions that prevailed after the earliest moments of the Universe, resulting in confirmation and refinement of the details of the Big Bang model. However, these accelerators can only probe so far into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-energy_physics" title="High-energy physics" class="mw-redirect">high energy regimes.</a> Consequently, the state of the Universe in the very earliest instants of the Big Bang expansion is still poorly understood and an area of open investigation.</p>
<p>The first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle" title="Subatomic particle">subatomic particles</a> included <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton" title="Proton">protons,</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron" title="Neutron">neutrons,</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron" title="Electron">electrons.</a> Though simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang_nucleosynthesis" title="Big bang nucleosynthesis" class="mw-redirect">atomic nuclei formed</a> within the first three minutes after the Big Bang, thousands of years passed before the first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)" title="Recombination (cosmology)">electrically neutral atoms formed.</a> The majority of atoms produced by the Big Bang were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen,</a> along with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium" title="Helium">helium</a> and traces of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium" title="Lithium">lithium.</a> Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity" title="Gravity" class="mw-redirect">gravity</a> to form <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star" title="Star">stars</a> and galaxies, and the heavier elements were synthesized either <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis" title="Stellar nucleosynthesis">within stars</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova_nucleosynthesis" title="Supernova nucleosynthesis">during supernovae.</a></p>
<p>The Big Bang theory offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background" title="Cosmic microwave background">cosmic microwave background,</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large-scale_structure_of_the_cosmos" title="Large-scale structure of the cosmos" class="mw-redirect">large scale structure,</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_Law" title="Hubble's Law" class="mw-redirect">Hubble's Law.</a> The framework for the Big Bang model relies on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>'s theory of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity" title="General relativity">general relativity</a> and on simplifying assumptions such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_(physics)#Translation_invariance" title="Homogeneity (physics)">homogeneity</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropy" title="Isotropy">isotropy</a> of space. The governing equations were formulated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Friedmann" title="Alexander Friedmann">Alexander Friedmann,</a> and similar solutions were worked on by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_de_Sitter" title="Willem de Sitter">Willem de Sitter.</a> Since then, astrophysicists have incorporated observational and theoretical additions into the Big Bang model, and its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametrization" title="Parametrization">parametrization</a> as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model" title="Lambda-CDM model">Lambda-CDM model</a> serves as the framework for current investigations of theoretical cosmology. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model" title="Lambda-CDM model">Lambda-CDM model</a> is the standard model of Big Bang cosmology, the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of various observations about the Universe.</p>
<h1>Timeline of the Big Bang</h1>
<h2>Singularity</h2>
<p>Extrapolation of the expansion of the Universe backwards in time using general relativity yields an infinite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density" title="Density">density</a> and temperature at a finite time in the past. This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity" title="Gravitational singularity">singularity</a> signals the breakdown of general relativity. How closely we can extrapolate towards the singularity is debated—certainly no closer than the end of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_epoch" title="Planck epoch">Planck epoch.</a> This singularity is sometimes called "the Big Bang", but the term can also refer to the early hot, dense phase itself, which can be considered the "birth" of our universe. Based on measurements of the expansion using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova" title="Type Ia supernova">Type Ia supernovae,</a> measurements of temperature fluctuations in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation" title="Cosmic microwave background radiation" class="mw-redirect">cosmic microwave background,</a> and measurements of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_function" title="Correlation function">correlation function</a> of galaxies, the Universe has an estimated age of 13.798 ± 0.037&#160;billion years. The agreement of these three independent measurements strongly supports the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model" title="Lambda-CDM model">ΛCDM model</a> that describes in detail the contents of the Universe.</p>
<h2>Inflation and baryogenesis</h2>
<p>The earliest phases of the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models the Universe was filled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity" title="Homogeneity and heterogeneity">homogeneously</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropic" title="Isotropic" class="mw-redirect">isotropically</a> with an incredibly high <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density" title="Energy density">energy density</a> and huge temperatures and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure" title="Pressure">pressures</a> and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10 seconds into the expansion, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition" title="Phase transition">phase transition</a> caused a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_inflation" title="Cosmic inflation" class="mw-redirect">cosmic inflation,</a> during which the Universe grew <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth" title="Exponential growth">exponentially.</a> After inflation stopped, the Universe consisted of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark%E2%80%93gluon_plasma" title="Quark–gluon plasma">quark–gluon plasma,</a> as well as all other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle" title="Elementary particle">elementary particles.</a> Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity" title="Special relativity">relativistic</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_speed" title="Relativistic speed">speeds,</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_production" title="Pair production">particle–antiparticle pairs</a> of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions. At some point an unknown reaction called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryogenesis" title="Baryogenesis">baryogenesis</a> violated the conservation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_number" title="Baryon number">baryon number,</a> leading to a very small excess of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark" title="Quark">quarks</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepton" title="Lepton">leptons</a> over antiquarks and antileptons—of the order of one part in 30&#160;million. This resulted in the predominance of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter" title="Matter">matter</a> over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter" title="Antimatter">antimatter</a> in the present universe.</p>
<h2>Cooling</h2>
Panoramic view of the entire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-infrared" title="Near-infrared" class="mw-redirect">near-infrared</a> sky reveals the distribution of galaxies beyond the Milky Way. Galaxies are color-coded by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift" title="Redshift">redshift.</a></div>
<p>The universe continued to decrease in density and fall in temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_symmetry_breaking" title="Explicit symmetry breaking">Symmetry breaking</a> phase transitions put the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_force" title="Fundamental force" class="mw-redirect">fundamental forces</a> of physics and the parameters of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particles" title="Elementary particles" class="mw-redirect">elementary particles</a> into their present form. After about 10 seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics" title="Particle physics">particle physics</a> experiments. At about 10 seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon" title="Baryon">baryons</a> such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was now no longer high enough to create new proton–antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons–antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 10 of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons. After these annihilations, the remaining protons, neutrons and electrons were no longer moving relativistically and the energy density of the Universe was dominated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon" title="Photon">photons</a> (with a minor contribution from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino" title="Neutrino">neutrinos</a>).</p>
<p>A few minutes into the expansion, when the temperature was about a billion (one thousand million; 10; SI prefix <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giga-" title="Giga-">giga-</a>) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin" title="Kelvin">kelvin</a> and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the Universe's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium" title="Deuterium">deuterium</a> and helium <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus" title="Atomic nucleus">nuclei</a> in a process called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis" title="Big Bang nucleosynthesis">Big Bang nucleosynthesis.</a> Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei. As the Universe cooled, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest_mass" title="Rest mass" class="mw-redirect">rest mass</a> energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate that of the photon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation" title="Electromagnetic radiation">radiation.</a> After about 379,000 years the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic radiation is known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation" title="Cosmic microwave background radiation" class="mw-redirect">cosmic microwave background radiation.</a> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry" title="Biochemistry">chemistry of life</a> may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe" title="Age of the universe">13.8 billion years ago,</a> during a habitable epoch when the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe" title="Universe">Universe</a> was only 10–17 million years old.</p>
<h2>Structure formation</h2>
<p>Over a long period of time, the slightly denser regions of the nearly uniformly distributed matter gravitationally attracted nearby matter and thus grew even denser, forming gas clouds, stars, galaxies, and the other astronomical structures observable today. The details of this process depend on the amount and type of matter in the Universe. The four possible types of matter are known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_dark_matter" title="Cold dark matter">cold dark matter,</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warm_dark_matter" title="Warm dark matter">warm dark matter,</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_dark_matter" title="Hot dark matter">hot dark matter,</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryonic_matter" title="Baryonic matter" class="mw-redirect">baryonic matter.</a> The best measurements available (from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMAP" title="WMAP" class="mw-redirect">WMAP</a>) show that the data is well-fit by a Lambda-CDM model in which dark matter is assumed to be cold (warm dark matter is ruled out by early <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reionization" title="Reionization">reionization</a>), and is estimated to make up about 23% of the matter/energy of the Universe, while baryonic matter makes up about 4.6%. In an "extended model" which includes hot dark matter in the form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino" title="Neutrino">neutrinos,</a> then if the "physical baryon density" Ω<sub>b</sub>h is estimated at about 0.023 (this is different from the 'baryon density' Ω<sub>b</sub> expressed as a fraction of the total matter/energy density, which as noted above is about 0.046), and the corresponding cold dark matter density Ω<sub>c</sub>h is about 0.11, the corresponding neutrino density Ω<sub>v</sub>h is estimated to be less than 0.0062.</p>
<h2>Cosmic acceleration</h2>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abell_2744" title="Abell 2744">Abell 2744</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_cluster" title="Galaxy cluster">galaxy cluster</a> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope#Frontier_Fields_program" title="Hubble Space Telescope">Hubble Frontier Fields view.</a></div>
<p>Independent lines of evidence from Type Ia supernovae and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation" title="Cosmic microwave background radiation" class="mw-redirect">CMB</a> imply that the Universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy" title="Dark energy">dark energy,</a> which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form. When the Universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law" title="Hubble's law">expansion of the universe</a> to slowly begin to accelerate. Dark energy in its simplest formulation takes the form of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant" title="Cosmological constant">cosmological constant</a> term in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%27s_field_equation" title="Einstein's field equation" class="mw-redirect">Einstein's field equations</a> of general relativity, but its composition and mechanism are unknown and, more generally, the details of its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_state_(cosmology)" title="Equation of state (cosmology)">equation of state</a> and relationship with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model" title="Standard Model">Standard Model</a> of particle physics continue to be investigated both observationally and theoretically.</p>
<p>All of this cosmic evolution after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflationary_epoch" title="Inflationary epoch">inflationary epoch</a> can be rigorously described and modelled by the ΛCDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks of quantum mechanics and Einstein's General Relativity. As noted above, there is no well-supported model describing the action prior to 10 seconds or so. Apparently a new unified theory of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity" title="Quantum gravity">quantum gravitation</a> is needed to break this barrier. Understanding this earliest of eras in the history of the Universe is currently one of the greatest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsolved_problems_in_physics" title="Unsolved problems in physics" class="mw-redirect">unsolved problems in physics.</a></p>
<h1>Underlying assumptions</h1>
<p>The Big Bang theory depends on two major assumptions: the universality of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_law" title="Physical law">physical laws</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_principle" title="Cosmological principle">cosmological principle.</a> The cosmological principle states that on large scales the Universe is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_space" title="Homogeneous space">homogeneous</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropy" title="Isotropy">isotropic.</a></p>
<p>These ideas were initially taken as postulates, but today there are efforts to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_structure_constant" title="Fine structure constant" class="mw-redirect">fine structure constant</a> over much of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe" title="Age of the universe">age of the universe</a> is of order 10. Also, general relativity has passed stringent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tests_of_general_relativity" title="Tests of general relativity">tests</a> on the scale of the Solar System and binary stars.</p>
<p>If the large-scale universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth, the cosmological principle can be derived from the simpler <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_principle" title="Copernican principle">Copernican principle,</a> which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point. To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10 via observations of the CMB. The Universe has been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the 10% level.</p>
<h2>Expansion of space</h2>
<p>General relativity describes spacetime by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor" title="Metric tensor">metric,</a> which determines the distances that separate nearby points. The points, which can be galaxies, stars, or other objects, themselves are specified using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_chart" title="Coordinate chart" class="mw-redirect">coordinate chart</a> or "grid" that is laid down over all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime" title="Spacetime">spacetime.</a> The cosmological principle implies that the metric should be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_space" title="Homogeneous space">homogeneous</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropic" title="Isotropic" class="mw-redirect">isotropic</a> on large scales, which uniquely singles out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker_metric" title="Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric">Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric</a> (FLRW metric). This metric contains a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_factor" title="Scale factor">scale factor,</a> which describes how the size of the Universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system" title="Coordinate system">coordinate system</a> to be made, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comoving_coordinates" title="Comoving coordinates" class="mw-redirect">comoving coordinates.</a> In this coordinate system the grid expands along with the Universe, and objects that are moving only due to the expansion of the Universe remain at fixed points on the grid. While their <i>coordinate</i> distance (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comoving_distance" title="Comoving distance">comoving distance</a>) remains constant, the <i>physical</i> distance between two such comoving points expands proportionally with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_factor" title="Scale factor">scale factor</a> of the Universe.</p>
<p>The Big Bang is not an explosion of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe. Instead, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space" title="Metric expansion of space">space itself expands</a> with time everywhere and increases the physical distance between two comoving points. In other words, the Big Bang is not an explosion <i>in space,</i> but rather an expansion <i>of space.</i> Because the FLRW metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy, it applies to our universe only on large scales—local concentrations of matter such as our galaxy are gravitationally bound and as such do not experience the large-scale expansion of space.</p>
<h2>Horizons</h2>
<p>An important feature of the Big Bang spacetime is the presence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_horizon#Particle_horizon" title="Particle horizon">horizons.</a> Since the Universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past whose light has not had time to reach us. This places a limit or a <i>past horizon</i> on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by us today may never "catch up" to very distant objects. This defines a <i>future horizon,</i> which limits the events in the future that we will be able to influence. The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the FLRW model that describes our universe. Our understanding of the Universe back to very early times <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang#Horizon_problem" title="Big Bang">suggests</a> that there is a past horizon, though in practice our view is also limited by the opacity of the Universe at early times. So our view cannot extend further backward in time, though the horizon recedes in space. If the expansion of the Universe continues to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_universe" title="Accelerating universe">accelerate,</a> there is a future horizon as well.</p>
<h1>History</h1>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>English astronomer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hoyle" title="Fred Hoyle">Fred Hoyle</a> is credited with coining the term "Big Bang" during a 1949 BBC radio broadcast. It is popularly reported that Hoyle, who favored an alternative "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady_state_universe" title="Steady state universe" class="mw-redirect">steady state</a>" cosmological model, intended this to be pejorative, but Hoyle explicitly denied this and said it was just a striking image meant to highlight the difference between the two models.</p>
<h2>Development</h2>
<p>The Big Bang theory developed from observations of the structure of the Universe and from theoretical considerations. In 1912 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesto_Slipher" title="Vesto Slipher">Vesto Slipher</a> measured the first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_shift" title="Doppler shift" class="mw-redirect">Doppler shift</a> of a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_nebula" title="Spiral nebula" class="mw-redirect">spiral nebula</a>" (spiral nebula is the obsolete term for spiral galaxies), and soon discovered that almost all such nebulae were receding from Earth. He did not grasp the cosmological implications of this fact, and indeed at the time it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley%E2%80%93Curtis_debate" title="Shapley–Curtis debate" class="mw-redirect">highly controversial</a> whether or not these nebulae were "island universes" outside our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way" title="Milky Way">Milky Way.</a> Ten years later, Alexander Friedmann, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russian</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology" title="Physical cosmology">cosmologist</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician" title="Mathematician">mathematician,</a> derived <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations" title="Friedmann equations">the Friedmann equations</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_equation" title="Einstein equation" class="mw-redirect">Albert Einstein's equations of general relativity,</a> showing that the Universe might be expanding in contrast to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_universe" title="Static universe">static universe</a> model advocated by Einstein at that time. In 1924 Edwin Hubble's measurement of the great distance to the nearest spiral nebulae showed that these systems were indeed other galaxies. Independently deriving Friedmann's equations in 1927, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lema%C3%AEtre" title="Georges Lemaître">Georges Lemaître,</a> a Belgian physicist and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic" title="Roman Catholic" class="mw-redirect">Roman Catholic</a> priest, proposed that the inferred recession of the nebulae was due to the expansion of the universe.</p>
<p>In 1931 Lemaître went further and suggested that the evident expansion of the Universe, if projected back in time, meant that the further in the past the smaller the Universe was, until at some finite time in the past all the mass of the Universe was concentrated into a single point, a "primeval atom" where and when the fabric of time and space came into existence.</p>
<p>Starting in 1924, Hubble painstakingly developed a series of distance indicators, the forerunner of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder" title="Cosmic distance ladder">cosmic distance ladder,</a> using the 100-inch (2,500&#160;mm) Hooker telescope at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Wilson_Observatory" title="Mount Wilson Observatory">Mount Wilson Observatory.</a> This allowed him to estimate distances to galaxies whose redshifts had already been measured, mostly by Slipher. In 1929 Hubble discovered a correlation between distance and recession velocity—now known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law" title="Hubble's law">Hubble's law.</a> Lemaître had already shown that this was expected, given the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_Principle" title="Cosmological Principle" class="mw-redirect">Cosmological Principle.</a></p>
<p>In the 1920s and 1930s almost every major cosmologist preferred an eternal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady_state_theory" title="Steady state theory" class="mw-redirect">steady state</a> universe, and several complained that the beginning of time implied by the Big Bang imported religious concepts into physics; this objection was later repeated by supporters of the steady state theory. This perception was enhanced by the fact that the originator of the Big Bang theory, Monsignor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lema%C3%AEtre" title="Georges Lemaître">Georges Lemaître,</a> was a Roman Catholic priest. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington" title="Arthur Eddington">Arthur Eddington</a> agreed with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> that the Universe did not have a beginning in time, viz., that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arguments_for_eternity#Argument_from_the_nature_of_matter" title="Arguments for eternity">matter is eternal.</a> A beginning in time was "repugnant" to him. Lemaître, however, thought that</p>
<p>If the world has begun with a single <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum,</a> the notions of space and time would altogether fail to have any meaning at the beginning; they would only begin to have a sensible meaning when the original quantum had been divided into a sufficient number of quanta. If this suggestion is correct, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_myth" title="Creation myth">beginning of the world</a> happened a little before the beginning of space and time.</p>
<p>During the 1930s other ideas were proposed as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-standard_cosmologies" title="Non-standard cosmologies" class="mw-redirect">non-standard cosmologies</a> to explain Hubble's observations, including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milne_model" title="Milne model">Milne model,</a> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillatory_universe" title="Oscillatory universe" class="mw-redirect">oscillatory universe</a> (originally suggested by Friedmann, but advocated by Albert Einstein and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Tolman" title="Richard Tolman" class="mw-redirect">Richard Tolman</a>) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Zwicky" title="Fritz Zwicky">Fritz Zwicky</a>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tired_light" title="Tired light">tired light</a> hypothesis.</p>
<p>After <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II,</a> two distinct possibilities emerged. One was Fred Hoyle's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady_state_model" title="Steady state model" class="mw-redirect">steady state model,</a> whereby new matter would be created as the Universe seemed to expand. In this model the Universe is roughly the same at any point in time. The other was Lemaître's Big Bang theory, advocated and developed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gamow" title="George Gamow">George Gamow,</a> who introduced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang_nucleosynthesis" title="Big bang nucleosynthesis" class="mw-redirect">big bang nucleosynthesis</a> (BBN) and whose associates, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Alpher" title="Ralph Alpher" class="mw-redirect">Ralph Alpher</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Herman" title="Robert Herman">Robert Herman,</a> predicted the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation" title="Cosmic microwave background radiation" class="mw-redirect">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> (CMB). Ironically, it was Hoyle who coined the phrase that came to be applied to Lemaître's theory, referring to it as "this <i>big bang</i> idea" during a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio" title="BBC Radio">BBC Radio</a> broadcast in March 1949. For a while, support was split between these two theories. Eventually, the observational evidence, most notably from radio <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_counts" title="Source counts">source counts,</a> began to favor Big Bang over Steady State. The discovery and confirmation of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964 secured the Big Bang as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the Universe. Much of the current work in cosmology includes understanding how galaxies form in the context of the Big Bang, understanding the physics of the Universe at earlier and earlier times, and reconciling observations with the basic theory.</p>
<p>Significant progress in Big Bang cosmology have been made since the late 1990s as a result of advances in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope" title="Telescope">telescope</a> technology as well as the analysis of data from satellites such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Background_Explorer" title="Cosmic Background Explorer">COBE,</a> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope" title="Hubble Space Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMAP" title="WMAP" class="mw-redirect">WMAP.</a> Cosmologists now have fairly precise and accurate measurements of many of the parameters of the Big Bang model, and have made the unexpected discovery that the expansion of the Universe appears to be accelerating.</p>

<p><em>"[The] big bang picture is too firmly grounded in data from every area to be proved invalid in its general features."</em></p>
<p>The earliest and most direct observational evidence of the validity of the theory are the expansion of the Universe according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law" title="Hubble's law">Hubble's law</a> (as indicated by the redshifts of galaxies), discovery and measurement of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background" title="Cosmic microwave background">cosmic microwave background</a> and the relative abundances of light elements produced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis" title="Big Bang nucleosynthesis">Big Bang nucleosynthesis.</a> More recent evidence includes observations of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_formation_and_evolution" title="Galaxy formation and evolution">galaxy formation and evolution,</a> and the distribution of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large-scale_structure_of_the_cosmos" title="Large-scale structure of the cosmos" class="mw-redirect">large-scale cosmic structures,</a> These are sometimes called the "four pillars" of the Big Bang theory.</p>
<p>Precise modern models of the Big Bang appeal to various exotic physical phenomena that have not been observed in terrestrial laboratory experiments or incorporated into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model" title="Standard Model">Standard Model</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics" title="Particle physics">particle physics.</a> Of these features, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter" title="Dark matter">dark matter</a> is currently subjected to the most active laboratory investigations. Remaining issues include the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuspy_halo_problem" title="Cuspy halo problem">cuspy halo problem</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_galaxy_problem" title="Dwarf galaxy problem">dwarf galaxy problem</a> of cold dark matter. Dark energy is also an area of intense interest for scientists, but it is not clear whether direct detection of dark energy will be possible. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)" title="Inflation (cosmology)">Inflation</a> and baryogenesis remain more speculative features of current Big Bang models. Viable, quantitative explanations for such phenomena are still being sought. These are currently unsolved problems in physics.</p>
<h2>Hubble's law and the expansion of space</h2>
<p>Observations of distant galaxies and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar" title="Quasar">quasars</a> show that these objects are redshifted—the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light" title="Light">light</a> emitted from them has been shifted to longer wavelengths. This can be seen by taking a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_spectrum" title="Frequency spectrum">frequency spectrum</a> of an object and matching the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy" title="Spectroscopy">spectroscopic</a> pattern of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_line" title="Emission line" class="mw-redirect">emission lines</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_line" title="Absorption line" class="mw-redirect">absorption lines</a> corresponding to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom" title="Atom">atoms</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element" title="Chemical element">chemical elements</a> interacting with the light. These redshifts are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_(physics)" title="Homogeneity (physics)">uniformly</a> isotropic, distributed evenly among the observed objects in all directions. If the redshift is interpreted as a Doppler shift, the recessional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity" title="Velocity">velocity</a> of the object can be calculated. For some galaxies, it is possible to estimate distances via the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder" title="Cosmic distance ladder">cosmic distance ladder.</a> When the recessional velocities are plotted against these distances, a linear relationship known as Hubble's law is observed:</p>
−1.4</span></span> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometers" title="Kilometers" class="mw-redirect">km</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second" title="Second">s</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaparsec" title="Megaparsec" class="mw-redirect">Mpc</a> by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMAP" title="WMAP" class="mw-redirect">WMAP</a> probe.</li>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law" title="Hubble's law">Hubble's law</a> has two possible explanations. Either we are at the center of an explosion of galaxies—which is untenable given the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_principle" title="Copernican principle">Copernican principle</a>—or the Universe is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space" title="Metric expansion of space">uniformly expanding</a> everywhere. This universal expansion was predicted from general relativity by Alexander Friedmann in 1922 and Georges Lemaître in 1927, well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker_metric" title="Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric">Friedmann, Lemaître, Robertson, and Walker.</a></p>
<p>The theory requires the relation <i>v</i> = <i>HD</i> to hold at all times, where <i>D</i> is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comoving_distance" title="Comoving distance">comoving distance,</a> <i>v</i> is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recessional_velocity" title="Recessional velocity">recessional velocity,</a> and <i>v,</i> <i>H,</i> and <i>D</i> vary as the Universe expands (hence we write <i>H</i><sub>0</sub> to denote the present-day Hubble "constant"). For distances much smaller than the size of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe" title="Observable universe">observable universe,</a> the Hubble redshift can be thought of as the Doppler shift corresponding to the recession velocity <i>v.</i> However, the redshift is not a true Doppler shift, but rather the result of the expansion of the Universe between the time the light was emitted and the time that it was detected.</p>
<p>That <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space" title="Metric expansion of space">space is undergoing metric expansion</a> is shown by direct observational evidence of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_principle" title="Cosmological principle">Cosmological principle</a> and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical redshifts are extremely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropic" title="Isotropic" class="mw-redirect">isotropic</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_(physics)#Translation_invariance" title="Homogeneity (physics)">homogeneous,</a> supporting the Cosmological principle that the Universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts were the result of an explosion from a center distant from us, they would not be so similar in different directions.</p>
<p>Measurements of the effects of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation" title="Cosmic microwave background radiation" class="mw-redirect">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the Copernican principle, that, on a cosmological scale, the Earth is not in a central position. Radiation from the Big Bang was demonstrably warmer at earlier times throughout the Universe. Uniform cooling of the cosmic microwave background over billions of years is explainable only if the Universe is experiencing a metric expansion, and excludes the possibility that we are near the unique center of an explosion.</p>
<h2>Cosmic microwave background radiation</h2>
9 year <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMAP" title="WMAP" class="mw-redirect">WMAP</a> image of the cosmic microwave background radiation (2012). The radiation is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropic" title="Isotropic" class="mw-redirect">isotropic</a> to roughly one part in 100,000.</div>
<p>In 1964 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Penzias" title="Arno Penzias" class="mw-redirect">Arno Penzias</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Woodrow_Wilson" title="Robert Woodrow Wilson">Robert Wilson</a> serendipitously discovered the cosmic background radiation, an omnidirectional signal in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave" title="Microwave">microwave</a> band. Their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the general CMB predictions: the radiation was found to be consistent with an almost perfect black body spectrum in all directions; this spectrum has been redshifted by the expansion of the Universe, and today corresponds to approximately 2.725&#160;K. This tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, and Penzias and Wilson were awarded a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize" title="Nobel Prize">Nobel Prize</a> in 1978.</p>
The cosmic microwave background spectrum measured by the FIRAS instrument on the COBE satellite is the most-precisely measured black body spectrum in nature. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_point" title="Data point">data points</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error_of_estimation" title="Standard error of estimation" class="mw-redirect">error bars</a> on this graph are obscured by the theoretical curve.</div>
<p>The <i>surface of last scattering</i> corresponding to emission of the CMB occurs shortly after <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)" title="Recombination (cosmology)">recombination,</a></i> the epoch when neutral hydrogen becomes stable. Prior to this, the Universe comprised a hot dense photon-baryon plasma sea where photons were quickly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_scattering" title="Thomson scattering">scattered</a> from free charged particles. Peaking at around <span class="nowrap">372<span style="margin-left:0.3em;margin-right:0.15em">±</span>14&#160;kyr,</span> the mean free path for a photon becomes long enough to reach the present day and the Universe becomes transparent.</p>
<p>In 1989 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA" title="NASA">NASA</a> launched the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Background_Explorer_satellite" title="Cosmic Background Explorer satellite" class="mw-redirect">Cosmic Background Explorer satellite</a> (COBE). Its findings were consistent with predictions regarding the CMB, finding a residual temperature of 2.726&#160;K (more recent measurements have revised this figure down slightly to 2.725&#160;K) and providing the first evidence for fluctuations (anisotropies) in the CMB, at a level of about one part in 10. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Mather" title="John C. Mather">John C. Mather</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Smoot" title="George Smoot">George Smoot</a> were awarded the Nobel Prize for their leadership in this work. During the following decade, CMB anisotropies were further investigated by a large number of ground-based and balloon experiments. In 2000–2001 several experiments, most notably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BOOMERanG_experiment" title="BOOMERanG experiment">BOOMERanG,</a> found the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe" title="Shape of the universe">shape of the universe</a> to be spatially almost flat by measuring the typical angular size (the size on the sky) of the anisotropies.</p>
<p>In early 2003 the first results of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMAP" title="WMAP" class="mw-redirect">Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe</a> (WMAP) were released, yielding what were at the time the most accurate values for some of the cosmological parameters. The results disproved several specific <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_inflation" title="Cosmic inflation" class="mw-redirect">cosmic inflation</a> models, but are consistent with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_theory" title="Inflation theory" class="mw-redirect">inflation theory</a> in general. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_(spacecraft)" title="Planck (spacecraft)">Planck</a> space probe was launched in May 2009. Other ground and balloon based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cosmic_microwave_background_experiments" title="List of cosmic microwave background experiments">cosmic microwave background experiments</a> are ongoing.</p>
<h2>Abundance of primordial elements</h2>
<p>Using the Big Bang model it is possible to calculate the concentration of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium-4" title="Helium-4">helium-4,</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium-3" title="Helium-3">helium-3,</a> deuterium, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-7" title="Lithium-7" class="mw-redirect">lithium-7</a> in the Universe as ratios to the amount of ordinary hydrogen. The relative abundances depend on a single parameter, the ratio of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon" title="Photon">photons</a> to baryons. This value can be calculated independently from the detailed structure of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation" title="Cosmic microwave background radiation" class="mw-redirect">CMB</a> fluctuations. The ratios predicted (by mass, not by number) are about 0.25 for <span class="unicode" style="white-space:nowrap;"><span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:0.8em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:85%; text-align:right;">4</span>He</span>/<span class="unicode" style="white-space:nowrap;">H,</span> about 10 for <span class="unicode" style="white-space:nowrap;"><span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:0.8em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:85%; text-align:right;">2</span>H</span>/<span class="unicode" style="white-space:nowrap;">H,</span> about 10 for <span class="unicode" style="white-space:nowrap;"><span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:0.8em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:85%; text-align:right;">3</span>He</span>/<span class="unicode" style="white-space:nowrap;">H</span> and about 10 for <span class="unicode" style="white-space:nowrap;"><span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:0.8em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:85%; text-align:right;">7</span>Li</span>/<span class="unicode" style="white-space:nowrap;">H.</span></p>
<p>The measured abundances all agree at least roughly with those predicted from a single value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. The agreement is excellent for deuterium, close but formally discrepant for <span class="unicode" style="white-space:nowrap;"><span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:0.8em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:85%; text-align:right;">4</span>He,</span> and off by a factor of two for <span class="unicode" style="white-space:nowrap;"><span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:0.8em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:85%; text-align:right;">7</span>Li</span>; in the latter two cases there are substantial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_error" title="Systematic error">systematic uncertainties.</a> Nonetheless, the general consistency with abundances predicted by Big Bang nucleosynthesis is strong evidence for the Big Bang, as the theory is the only known explanation for the relative abundances of light elements, and it is virtually impossible to "tune" the Big Bang to produce much more or less than 20–30% helium. Indeed there is no obvious reason outside of the Big Bang that, for example, the young universe (i.e., before star formation, as determined by studying matter supposedly free of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis" title="Stellar nucleosynthesis">stellar nucleosynthesis</a> products) should have more helium than deuterium or more deuterium than <span class="unicode" style="white-space:nowrap;"><span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:0.8em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:85%; text-align:right;">3</span>He,</span> and in constant ratios, too.</p>
<h2>Galactic evolution and distribution</h2>
<p>Detailed observations of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_morphological_classification" title="Galaxy morphological classification">morphology</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large-scale_structure_of_the_cosmos" title="Large-scale structure of the cosmos" class="mw-redirect">distribution</a> of galaxies and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasars" title="Quasars" class="mw-redirect">quasars</a> are in agreement with the current state of the Big Bang theory. A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the Big Bang, and since then larger structures have been forming, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_clusters" title="Galaxy clusters" class="mw-redirect">galaxy clusters</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercluster" title="Supercluster">superclusters.</a> Populations of stars have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are observed as they were in the early universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation" title="Star formation">star formation,</a> galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the Universe and are helping to complete details of the theory.</p>
<h2>Primordial gas clouds</h2>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_plane" title="Focal plane" class="mw-redirect">Focal plane</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP2" title="BICEP2" class="mw-redirect">BICEP2 telescope</a> under a microscope - may have detected <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_waves" title="Gravitational waves" class="mw-redirect">gravitational waves</a> from the infant universe.</div>
<p>In 2011 astronomers found what they believe to be pristine clouds of primordial gas, by analyzing absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. These two clouds of gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium. Since the clouds of gas have no heavy elements, they likely formed in the first few minutes after the Big Bang, during <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis" title="Big Bang nucleosynthesis">Big Bang nucleosynthesis.</a> Their composition matches the composition predicted from Big Bang nucleosynthesis. This provides direct evidence that there was a period in the history of the Universe before the formation of the first stars, when most ordinary matter existed in the form of clouds of neutral hydrogen.</p>
<h2>Other lines of evidence</h2>
<p>The age of universe as estimated from the Hubble expansion and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation" title="Cosmic microwave background radiation" class="mw-redirect">CMB</a> is now in good agreement with other estimates using the ages of the oldest stars, both as measured by applying the theory of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution" title="Stellar evolution">stellar evolution</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_clusters" title="Globular clusters" class="mw-redirect">globular clusters</a> and through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometric_dating" title="Radiometric dating">radiometric dating</a> of individual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_II" title="Population II" class="mw-redirect">Population II</a> stars.</p>
<p>The prediction that the CMB temperature was higher in the past has been experimentally supported by observations of very low temperature absorption lines in gas clouds at high redshift. This prediction also implies that the amplitude of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunyaev%E2%80%93Zel%27dovich_effect" title="Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect">Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clusters_of_galaxies" title="Clusters of galaxies" class="mw-redirect">clusters of galaxies</a> does not depend directly on redshift. Observations have found this to be roughly true, but this effect depends on cluster properties that do change with cosmic time, making precise measurements difficult.</p>
<p>On 17 March 2014, astronomers at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard-Smithsonian_Center_for_Astrophysics" title="Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics" class="mw-redirect">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</a> announced the apparent detection of primordial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_waves" title="Gravitational waves" class="mw-redirect">gravitational waves,</a> which, if confirmed, may provide strong evidence for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)" title="Inflation (cosmology)">inflation</a> and the Big Bang. However, on 19 June 2014, lowered confidence in confirming the findings was reported; and on 19 September 2014, even more lowered confidence.</p>

<h2>Baryon asymmetry</h2>
<p>It is not yet understood why the Universe has more matter than antimatter. It is generally assumed that when the Universe was young and very hot, it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the Universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakharov_conditions" title="Sakharov conditions" class="mw-redirect">Sakharov conditions</a> must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-symmetry" title="C-symmetry">C-symmetry</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP-symmetry" title="CP-symmetry" class="mw-redirect">CP-symmetry</a> are violated and that the Universe depart from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_equilibrium" title="Thermodynamic equilibrium">thermodynamic equilibrium.</a> All these conditions occur in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model" title="Standard Model">Standard Model,</a> but the effect is not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry.</p>
<h2>Dark energy</h2>
The accelerated expansion of space. In this illustration, time flows from bottom to top.</div>
<p>Measurements of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift" title="Redshift">redshift</a>–<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude" title="Apparent magnitude">magnitude</a> relation for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova" title="Type Ia supernova">type Ia supernovae</a> indicate that the expansion of the Universe has been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_universe" title="Accelerating universe">accelerating</a> since the Universe was about half its present age. To explain this acceleration, general relativity requires that much of the energy in the Universe consists of a component with large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_state_(cosmology)" title="Equation of state (cosmology)">negative pressure,</a> dubbed "dark energy". Dark energy, though speculative, solves numerous problems. Measurements of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background" title="Cosmic microwave background">cosmic microwave background</a> indicate that the Universe is very nearly spatially flat, and therefore according to general relativity the Universe must have almost exactly the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_density_(cosmology)" title="Critical density (cosmology)" class="mw-redirect">critical density</a> of mass/energy. But the mass density of the Universe can be measured from its gravitational clustering, and is found to have only about 30% of the critical density. Since theory suggests that dark energy does not cluster in the usual way it is the best explanation for the "missing" energy density. Dark energy also helps to explain two geometrical measures of the overall curvature of the Universe, one using the frequency of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens" title="Gravitational lens">gravitational lenses,</a> and the other using the characteristic pattern of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large-scale_structure_of_the_universe" title="Large-scale structure of the universe" class="mw-redirect">large-scale structure</a> as a cosmic ruler.</p>
<p>Negative pressure is believed to be a property of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_energy" title="Vacuum energy">vacuum energy,</a> but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Possible candidates include a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant" title="Cosmological constant">cosmological constant</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintessence_(physics)" title="Quintessence (physics)">quintessence.</a> Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos. According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the Universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the Universe expands. Therefore matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the Universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_future" title="Far future">far future</a> as dark energy becomes even more dominant.</p>
<h2>Dark matter</h2>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_chart" title="Pie chart">Chart</a> shows the proportion of different components of the universe &#160;–  about 95% is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter" title="Dark matter">dark matter</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy" title="Dark energy">dark energy.</a></div>
<p>During the 1970s and 80s, various observations showed that there is not sufficient visible matter in the Universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the Universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon" title="Baryon">baryonic</a> matter. In addition, the assumption that the Universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the Universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_cluster" title="Galaxy cluster">galaxy cluster</a> velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lensing" title="Gravitational lensing" class="mw-redirect">gravitational lensing</a> studies, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_astronomy" title="X-ray astronomy">X-ray measurements</a> of galaxy clusters.</p>
<p>Indirect evidence for dark matter comes from its gravitational influence on other matter, as no dark matter particles have been observed in laboratories. Many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics" title="Particle physics">particle physics</a> candidates for dark matter have been proposed, and several projects to detect them directly are underway.</p>
<h2>Globular cluster age</h2>
<p>In the mid-1990s observations of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster" title="Globular cluster">globular clusters</a> appeared to be inconsistent with the Big Bang theory. Computer simulations that matched the observations of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star" title="Star">stellar</a> populations of globular clusters suggested that they were about 15&#160;billion years old, which conflicted with the 13.8&#160;billion year age of the Universe. This issue was partially resolved in the late 1990s when new computer simulations, which included the effects of mass loss due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_wind" title="Stellar wind">stellar winds,</a> indicated a much younger age for globular clusters. There remain some questions as to how accurately the ages of the clusters are measured, but it is clear that observations of globular clusters no longer appear inconsistent with the Big Bang theory.</p>
<h1><span id="Problems">Problems</span></h1>
<p>There are generally considered to be three outstanding problems with the Big Bang theory: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_problem" title="Horizon problem">horizon problem,</a> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatness_problem" title="Flatness problem">flatness problem,</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole" title="Magnetic monopole">magnetic monopole problem.</a> The most common answer to these problems is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_inflation" title="Cosmic inflation" class="mw-redirect">inflationary theory</a>; however, since this creates new problems, other options have been proposed, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_curvature_hypothesis" title="Weyl curvature hypothesis">Weyl curvature hypothesis.</a></p>
<h2>Horizon problem</h2>
<p>The horizon problem results from the premise that information cannot travel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster_than_light" title="Faster than light" class="mw-redirect">faster than light.</a> In a universe of finite age this sets a limit—the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_horizon" title="Particle horizon">particle horizon</a>—on the separation of any two regions of space that are in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality_(physics)" title="Causality (physics)">causal</a> contact. The observed isotropy of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background" title="Cosmic microwave background">CMB</a> is problematic in this regard: if the Universe had been dominated by radiation or matter at all times up to the epoch of last scattering, the particle horizon at that time would correspond to about 2 degrees on the sky. There would then be no mechanism to cause wider regions to have the same temperature.</p>
<p>A resolution to this apparent inconsistency is offered by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflationary_theory" title="Inflationary theory" class="mw-redirect">inflationary theory</a> in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the Universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the Universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently on opposite sides of the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenberg%27s_uncertainty_principle" title="Heisenberg's uncertainty principle" class="mw-redirect">Heisenberg's uncertainty principle</a> predicts that during the inflationary phase there would be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_fluctuations" title="Primordial fluctuations">quantum thermal fluctuations,</a> which would be magnified to cosmic scale. These fluctuations serve as the seeds of all current structure in the Universe. Inflation predicts that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_fluctuations" title="Primordial fluctuations">primordial fluctuations</a> are nearly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_invariance" title="Scale invariance">scale invariant</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution" title="Normal distribution">Gaussian,</a> which has been accurately confirmed by measurements of the CMB.</p>
<p>If inflation occurred, exponential expansion would push large regions of space well beyond our observable horizon.</p>
<h2>Flatness problem</h2>
The overall <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe" title="Shape of the universe">geometry of the universe</a> is determined by whether the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_parameter" title="Density parameter" class="mw-redirect">Omega cosmological parameter</a> is less than, equal to or greater than 1. Shown from top to bottom are a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe#Spherical_universe" title="Shape of the universe">closed universe</a> with positive curvature, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe#Hyperbolic_universe" title="Shape of the universe">hyperbolic universe</a> with negative curvature and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_universe" title="Flat universe" class="mw-redirect">flat universe</a> with zero curvature.</div>
<p>The flatness problem (also known as the oldness problem) is an observational problem associated with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker_metric" title="Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric">Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric.</a> The Universe may have positive, negative, or zero spatial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature" title="Curvature">curvature</a> depending on its total energy density. Curvature is negative if its density is less than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_density_(cosmology)" title="Critical density (cosmology)" class="mw-redirect">critical density,</a> positive if greater, and zero at the critical density, in which case space is said to be <i>flat.</i> The problem is that any small departure from the critical density grows with time, and yet the Universe today remains very close to flat. Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_time" title="Planck time">Planck time,</a> 10 seconds, the fact that the Universe has reached neither a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe" title="Heat death of the universe">heat death</a> nor a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Crunch" title="Big Crunch">Big Crunch</a> after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the Universe density must have been within one part in 10 of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.</p>
<p>A resolution to this problem is offered by inflationary theory. During the inflationary period, spacetime expanded to such an extent that its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature" title="Curvature">curvature</a> would have been smoothed out. Thus, it is theorized that inflation drove the Universe to a very nearly spatially flat state, with almost exactly the critical density.</p>
<h2>Magnetic monopoles</h2>
<p>The magnetic monopole objection was raised in the late 1970s. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_unification_theory" title="Grand unification theory" class="mw-redirect">Grand unification theories</a> predicted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_defect" title="Topological defect">topological defects</a> in space that would manifest as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole" title="Magnetic monopole">magnetic monopoles.</a> These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that no monopoles have been found. This problem is also resolved by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_inflation" title="Cosmic inflation" class="mw-redirect">cosmic inflation,</a> which removes all point defects from the observable universe, in the same way that it drives the geometry to flatness.</p>
<h1>The future according to the Big Bang theory</h1>
<p>Before observations of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios for the future of the Universe. If the mass <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density" title="Density">density</a> of the Universe were greater than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_density_(cosmology)" title="Critical density (cosmology)" class="mw-redirect">critical density,</a> then the Universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started—a Big Crunch. Alternatively, if the density in the Universe were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out leaving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf" title="White dwarf">white dwarfs,</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star" title="Neutron star">neutron stars,</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole" title="Black hole">black holes.</a> Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the Universe would asymptotically approach <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero" title="Absolute zero">absolute zero</a>—a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Freeze" title="Big Freeze" class="mw-redirect">Big Freeze.</a> Moreover, if the proton were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_decay" title="Proton decay">unstable,</a> then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation" title="Hawking radiation">Hawking radiation.</a> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy" title="Entropy">entropy</a> of the Universe would increase to the point where no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as heat death.</p>
<p>Modern observations of accelerating expansion imply that more and more of the currently visible universe will pass beyond our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon" title="Event horizon">event horizon</a> and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The ΛCDM model of the Universe contains dark energy in the form of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant" title="Cosmological constant">cosmological constant.</a> This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the Universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_energy" title="Phantom energy">phantom energy</a> theories, suggest that ultimately galaxy clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, and matter itself will be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Rip" title="Big Rip">Big Rip.</a></p>

This is an artist's concept of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space" title="Metric expansion of space">metric expansion of space,</a> where space (including hypothetical non-observable portions of the universe) is represented at each time by the circular sections.

<p>While the Big Bang model is well established in cosmology, it is likely to be refined. The equations of classical general relativity indicate a singularity at the origin of cosmic time, although this conclusion depends on several assumptions and the equations break down at any time before the Universe reached the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_temperature" title="Planck temperature">Planck temperature.</a> A correct treatment of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity" title="Quantum gravity">quantum gravity</a> may avoid the would-be singularity.</p>

<p>Proposals in the last two categories, see the Big Bang as an event in either a much larger and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose#An_earlier_universe" title="Roger Penrose">older universe</a> or in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse" title="Multiverse">multiverse.</a></p>
<h1>Religious and philosophical interpretations</h1>
<p>As a description of the origin of the Universe, the Big Bang has significant bearing on religion and philosophy.
